# Time-Series-Forecasting-Improving-Store-Sales-Prediction
Improving Sales Forecasting Accuracy for Grocery Retailers Using Time-Series Analysis.

How I procedded in this project?

Load the dataset containing the sales data, store information, item details, and promotions.
Check for missing values and handle them appropriately (e.g., imputation or removal).
Convert date columns to datetime objects and set them as the index for time series data.

Generate summary statistics to understand the distribution of numerical variables.
Create visualizations such as line plots, histograms, and scatter plots to explore trends, seasonality, and patterns.
Analyze the distribution of sales, promotions, and other relevant variables.
Investigate correlations between variables using techniques like correlation matrices or heatmap plots.
Time Resampling:

If the data has irregular time intervals, resample it to a regular time interval (e.g., daily, weekly) using aggregation functions like sum or mean. This step ensures a consistent time series for analysis.
Time Series Transformation:

If the data exhibits non-stationarity (i.e., the mean, variance, or seasonality change over time), apply transformations to make it stationary.
Common transformations include taking the logarithm, square root, or differencing the time series.
Time Series Plotting:

Create time series plots of the transformed data to visualize the trends and patterns better.
Feature Engineering:

Identify and create additional relevant features that might impact sales, such as lagged values, moving averages, or rolling statistics.
Train-Test Split:

Split the dataset into training and test sets, considering the temporal order of the data. Typically, the more recent data is used for testing.
Time Series Forecasting Model:

Choose a suitable time series forecasting model, such as simple exponential smoothing, double exponential smoothing (Holt-Winters), or rolling averages.
Train the model using the training set and tune hyperparameters if applicable.
Model Evaluation:

Make predictions on the test set using the trained model.
Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), or Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE).
Forecasting Future Sales:

Retrain the selected model using the entire dataset (training + test) if needed.
Use the trained model to make predictions for future time periods beyond the test set.
